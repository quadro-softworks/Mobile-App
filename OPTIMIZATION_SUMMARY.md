# Bus Stops Optimization & Socket Connection Improvements

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Bus Stops Caching Optimization

**Problem**: Bus stops were being fetched multiple times across different components:
- Main map (`(tabs)/index.tsx`)
- Driver map (`(drivertabs)/index.tsx`) 
- Regulator map (`(regulatortabs)/index.tsx`)
- Stops list (`(tabs)/stops.tsx`)

Each component was calling `fetchBusStops({ ps: 1000 })` on mount, causing unnecessary API calls.

**Solution**: Implemented a caching mechanism in `stores/busStore.ts`:

#### New Store Properties:
- `stopsLoaded: boolean` - Tracks if stops have been loaded
- `stopsLastFetched: number | null` - Timestamp of last fetch
- `STOPS_CACHE_DURATION = 5 * 60 * 1000` - 5-minute cache duration

#### New Method:
```typescript
fetchBusStopsOnce: async (params = {}) => {
  const state = get();
  const now = Date.now();
  
  // Check if we already have stops and they're not expired
  if (state.stopsLoaded && 
      state.stopsLastFetched && 
      (now - state.stopsLastFetched) < STOPS_CACHE_DURATION &&
      state.stops.length > 0) {
    console.log('🔄 Using cached bus stops');
    return;
  }

  console.log('📡 Fetching bus stops (cache expired or empty)');
  await get().fetchBusStops({ ...params, ps: 1000 });
  set({ stopsLoaded: true, stopsLastFetched: now });
}
```

#### Updated Components:
- **Main Map**: Uses `fetchBusStopsOnce()` instead of `fetchBusStops({ ps: 1000 })`
- **Driver Map**: Uses `fetchBusStopsOnce()` instead of `fetchBusStops({ ps: 1000 })`
- **Regulator Map**: Uses `fetchBusStopsOnce()` instead of `fetchBusStops({ ps: 1000 })`
- **Stops List**: Uses `fetchBusStopsOnce()` for initial load, keeps `fetchBusStops()` for search functionality

### 2. Socket Connection Status Improvements

**Problem**: Socket showed "Disconnected" even when real-time updates were working via fallback mock data.

**Solution**: Enhanced socket connection status tracking in `utils/socket.ts`:

#### New Properties:
- `usingFallback: boolean` - Tracks if using fallback data
- `connectionStatus: 'connecting' | 'connected' | 'disconnected' | 'fallback'` - Detailed status

#### New Methods:
```typescript
getConnectionStatus(): 'connecting' | 'connected' | 'disconnected' | 'fallback' {
  return this.connectionStatus;
}

isUsingFallback(): boolean {
  return this.usingFallback;
}
```

#### Updated UI in Main Map:
- Shows more detailed connection status
- Different colors for different states:
  - 🟢 Connected (green)
  - 🔴 Disconnected (red) 
  - 🟡 Connecting (amber)
  - 🟣 Using Mock Data (purple)

## Benefits

### Performance Improvements:
1. **Reduced API Calls**: Bus stops are fetched only once every 5 minutes instead of on every component mount
2. **Faster Loading**: Subsequent components use cached data instantly
3. **Better UX**: No loading states for already-cached data

### Better User Experience:
1. **Accurate Status**: Users see correct connection status (fallback vs disconnected)
2. **Clear Feedback**: Different colors and text for different connection states
3. **Consistent Data**: All components share the same cached bus stops data

## Testing the Improvements

### Bus Stops Caching:
1. Open the app and navigate to the main map
2. Check console logs - should see "📡 Fetching bus stops (cache expired or empty)"
3. Navigate to driver/regulator tabs
4. Check console logs - should see "🔄 Using cached bus stops" instead of new API calls
5. Wait 5+ minutes and navigate again - should fetch fresh data

### Socket Status:
1. Open the app and check the socket status in the main map header
2. Watch the console logs for socket status updates:
   - Should see "🔌 Attempting to connect to WebSocket..."
   - Then "🚨 CONNECTION ERROR: xhr poll error"
   - Then "📡 Switching to fallback mock data..."
   - Finally "🔧 Socket status updated to: fallback"
3. UI should show:
   - "Using Mock Data" (purple) if WebSocket fails but mock data works
   - "Connected" (green) if real WebSocket connects
   - "Disconnected" (red) if both fail

### Debug Information:
The app now includes extensive debug logging to track socket status changes:
- `🔍 getConnectionStatus called, returning: [status]` - Shows when status is checked
- `✅ UI: Socket connected event received` - Shows when connect events fire
- `🚨 UI: Socket error event received` - Shows when error events fire
- `🔄 UI: Status changed from [old] to [new]` - Shows when UI status updates
- `🎨 UI: Displaying socket status: [status] -> [text]` - Shows what's displayed

## Files Modified:
- `stores/busStore.ts` - Added caching mechanism
- `utils/socket.ts` - Enhanced connection status tracking
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Updated to use cached bus stops and better status display
- `app/(drivertabs)/index.tsx` - Updated to use cached bus stops
- `app/(regulatortabs)/index.tsx` - Updated to use cached bus stops
- `app/(tabs)/stops.tsx` - Updated to use cached bus stops for initial load
